    <h2>Ohm's Law</h2>
    <p>Ohm’s law states the relationship between electric current and potential difference. The current that flows through most conductors is directly proportional to the voltage applied to it. Georg Simon Ohm, a German physicist was the first to verify Ohm’s law experimentally.</p>
    <h3>Formula in Series Circuit:</h3>
    <p><strong>Rtotal = R1 + R2 + . . . Rn</strong> (The total equivalent resistance of a series circuit is equal to the sum of the individual resistances)</p>
    <p><strong>Itotal = I1 = I2 = . . . In</strong> (All components in a series circuit conduct the same current)</p>
    <p><strong>Vtotal = V1 + V2 + . . . Vn</strong> (The total voltage drop in a series circuit is equal to the sum of the individual voltage drops)</p>
    <p><strong>V = IR</strong> (Voltage = Current × Resistance)</p>

    <h3>Applications</h3>
    <p>When the other two numbers are known, Ohm’s law may be used to determine the voltage, current, impedance, or resistance of a linear electric circuit.
      <br>
      <br>Main applications of Ohm’s Law:
      <br>
      <br>1. It also simplifies power calculations.
      <br>2. To keep the desired voltage drop between the electrical components, Ohm’s law is employed.
      <br>3. An electric circuit’s voltage, resistance, or current must be determined.
      <br>4. Ohm’s law is also utilised to redirect current in DC ammeters and other DC shunts.</p>
